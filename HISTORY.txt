v0.2 (XXXX-XX-XX)
==================

CURRENT DEVELOPMENT VERSION

- Sped up many of the functions in galpy.util.bovy_coords by removing scipy.frompyfunc dependency.

- Allow Orbit initialization to specify a distance and velocity scale that is then used to output distances and velocities in physical coordinates.

- Changed default vo and ro to 220 km/s and 8 kpc, respectively;

- Better handling of vo,ro, and solarmotion in Orbit instances (Orbit initialization value is now used to generate RA, Dec, etc. outputs);

- Started on adding virial radius of NFW potential, allow initialization of NFW potential with concentration and mass;

- Started adding potential.mass to return the mass enclosed;

- Added --no-openmp installation option to allow installation without OpenMP support (workaround for clang not supporting OpenMP);

- Added galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_gevcc, galpy.util.bovy_conversion.force_in_10m13kms2, galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_criticaldens, galpy.util.bovy_conversion.dens_in_meanmatterdens.
